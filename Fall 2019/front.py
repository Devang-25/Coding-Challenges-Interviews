Write a function to return a boolean if a word is splittable.
For example, isdogread is splittable, because is dog and read are words.
idsogb is not splittable, because there isnâ€™t a way to split it into words.
Assume you are given a function isWord that returns true / false for whether the word is valid.

        i = j
        break
      else:
        j += 1
